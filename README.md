neural-politics
===============

This is using a [js neural network](https://github.com/harthur/brain)

and 

the [Open Secrets Api](https://www.opensecrets.org/resources/create/apis.php)

to take some training decisions on legislator opinion and guess on subsequent legislators.

Implementation is very basic so far.
